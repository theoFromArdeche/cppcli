# **C++ CLI**

A simple command-line interface (CLI) for writing and executing C++ code interactively. This project allows you to write and run C++ code in real-time, with features like multiline input, tab spacing, and command history.

---


## **Features**

### **Execution Modes**
- **Script Mode (Default)**
  - Immediate line-by-line execution
  - Output displays once (like Python REPL)
  - Non-output lines persist for future execution
  - Ideal for quick syntax tests or calculations using C++'s power

- **File Mode**
  - Full multi-line editing (enter with `file` command)
  - Two run modes (toggle with Ctrl+T):
    - **Context Mode**: Shares variables with Script Mode
    - **Temporary Mode**: Completely isolated execution
  - All lines persist in file buffer
  - Perfect for complex code and output

### **Core Features**
- **Smart Output Handling**: Automatic output management
- **Customizable Tab Size**: Configure via `.env` file
- **Command History**: Arrow keys navigation
- **Session Management**:
  - `reset script`: Clear script buffer
  - `reset file`: Clear file buffer
  - `clear`: Clean terminal

## **Key Behaviors**
| Feature          | Script Mode               | File Mode                 |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Output           | Shows once                | Shows every execution     |
| Persistence      | Only non-output lines     | All lines saved           |
| Variable Scope   | Persistent                | Configurable (see modes)  |
| Best For         | Quick tests, variables    | Complex logic, output     |

## **How It Works**

The program uses the `linenoise` library for line editing and command history. It compiles and executes the entered C++ code in real-time, displaying the output in the terminal.

### **Key Implementation Details**

1. **Tab size**:
   - The number of spaces inserted by the **Tab** key is configurable via the `TAB_SIZE` variable in the `.env` file.
   - Example `.env` file:
     ```plaintext
     TAB_SIZE=4
     ```

2. **Multiline Mode**:
   - When in multiline mode, the program collects input until **Ctrl+X** is pressed.
   - The current line is saved, and the program exits multiline mode.

3. **Command Handling**:
   - The program supports commands like `file`, `clear`, `reset`, and `help`.

## **How to Run**

### **Prerequisites**

- **GCC** (GNU Compiler Collection) or another C++ compiler.
- **CMake** (optional, for building the project).

### **Build and Run**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theoFromArdeche/cppcli.git
   cd cppcli
   ```

2. Build the project:
   - Using `gcc` and `g++`:
     ```bash
     cd src
     gcc -c linenoise.c -o linenoise.o
     g++ main.cpp linenoise.o -o cppcli
     ```
   - Using CMake:
     ```bash
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./cppcli
   ```


## **Add to PATH**

To make the `cppcli` executable available globally, you can add it to your system's **PATH**. Hereâ€™s how:

### **Linux/macOS**

1. Add the directory containing the `cppcli` executable to your PATH:
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cppcli
   ```

   To make this change permanent, add the above line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`).

2. Verify the executable is in your PATH:
   ```bash
   which cppcli
   ```

### **Windows**

1. Add the directory containing `cppcli.exe` to your PATH:
   - Open **System Properties** > **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System Variables**, find the `Path` variable and click **Edit**.
   - Add the directory containing `cppcli.exe` to the list.

2. Verify the executable is in your PATH:
   ```cmd
   where cppcli
   ```

## **Example Usage**

1. Start the program:
   ```bash
   cppcli
   ```

2. Enter multiline mode:
   ```plaintext
   >>> file
   >>> file (Ctrl+X to exit)
   for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
       cout << i << endl;
   }
   ^X
   >>> End of file
   0
   1
   2
   3
   4
   5
   >>> 
   ```

3. Clear the screen:
   ```plaintext
   >>> clear
   ```

4. Reset the code buffer:
   ```plaintext
   >>> reset
   ```

5. Exit the program:
   ```plaintext
   >>> exit
   ```

## **Customization**

### **Tab size**

To change the number of spaces inserted by the **Tab** key, modify the `TAB_SIZE` variable in the `.env` file:

```plaintext
TAB_SIZE=8
```
