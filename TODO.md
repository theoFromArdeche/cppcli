- file : being able to navigate the file and make changes


TODO : the cursor should be working the same as in .txt for example when going up or down (not always same pos but its the same if possible)



TODO : send a signal after arrow up/down to tell the cpp (char at the end of the line, like ctrl-d works)

TODO : do the cpp part of the new file mode 
    receive arrows up and down and modify the right line
    (maybe use two stack, stack_before and stack_after)


TODO : add some IDE things like :
    generating the closing char for "" () [] {} 
    auto indent when pressing enter in a indented area
