- file : being able to navigate the file and make changes


TODO : when pressing backspace we should be able to delete a line


TODO : add some IDE things like :
    generating the closing char for "" () [] {} 
    auto indent when pressing enter in a indented area



TODO : add a way to go back into the prev file

TODO : maybe a way to have saved files and load them (either at the end of the prev file or overwrite the prev file)



TODO : modify the help function to explain how the files works (and how the output works in script and in file)
